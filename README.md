# Tomato-Disease-Prediction

Used Transfer Learning to create a model (VGG19) using Tensorflow.

VGG-19, also known as VGGNet-19, is a 19-layer deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model used for large-scale image recognition. The model's name refers to the number of convolutional layers it has.

The dataset contains 10 Categories, displaying the 9 different type of diseases and 1 category for healthy tomato.
